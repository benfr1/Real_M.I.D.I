 # Philosophy

A. The difference should be subtle or sounding almost completely like the original (to the exception of sung / human voice tracks).
A1. If you play the original file along with this real midi, there shall be no , or very little, difference. 
A2. If you play the original file, mute it, listen, and then mute the midi, listen to the original, back and forth, you should hear no difference. 

# Method

1. Volume is NEVER set on the beginning of the composition, but after the end. Usually at bar 150 or 300 or 450 or 600. It allows you to start from the original sounding, and modify subtly as per your enjoyment.
2. CC#11 is used in conjunction with CC Velocity to control the track's volume.
3. Additional tracks of DRUM TRACKS are sometimes purposely kept away from Track channel #10 (which is used for drums, usually). This is in order to adress suble differences (volume rises etc.).
In such case, the BIRDS GM sound program is set. You need to modify it back to a drum sound (still it keeps the channel midi not equal to #10).

# Organization

Folder 1 : title / tune or collection or album
Subfolder : sub tracks 
Subfolder "old" : older versions.
For instance :
Once upon a time in space > P18 > ieuflesp18.mid represents the tune number 18 ("P18" P for Piste which means Track in french) inside of the album "Once upon a time in space".
This allows, in the future, to have either a single midi file with different versions, or , even, a different midi name if someone wishes to says it's "this" or "that" personal version.

# Method to produce Real MIDI 

1. Define the absolutely right TEMPO. Do not go any further until set.
2. One instrument at a time : from beginning to end.
3. Then use the switch real tune / midi tune to compare by hear at any moment of the tune. They should hear so similar !
4. Set track volume indication at measure 150/300/450/600.
5. Use a decent GM sound set to work with.

This is produced by Benny Graal and it is available for all passionates.

# Use

Put the midi file on your instrument and allocate instruments. Play it at measure 150/300/450/600 in order to finely preset the tracks volumes.
Play or your Synth
Dance, play over it, ENJOY !
